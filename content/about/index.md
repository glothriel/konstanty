Design of migration system, that allowed migrating the infrastructures from previous platform, based on ansible and Rancher 1.6 (pre-kubernetes). The platform is used by 4 development and 3 DevOps teams to deliver the software every two weeks for more than 3000 clients. Design and development of release and test automation frameworks for whole platform. I was a member of a team that was responsible for obtaining SOC-2 certification, I contributed a lot of ideas and their implementation (automated nightly trivy scans and short slack reports with the results, optional falco deployments and alerts, alerts based on access logs, immutable logs storage, auto-expiration of extended privileges for developers debugging on production), that helped with obtaining the certificate.

### DevOps Engineer (03.2019 - 03.2020)

Led a small team of 3 people, that managed to solve the problem with long and error-prone manual upgrade instructions by replacing them with a simple system using python-based DSL, used to migrate ansible inventory variables and execute ansible playbooks. Participating in on-call rotation for multiple systems.
