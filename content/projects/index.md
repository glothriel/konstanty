## <a href="https://github.com/glothriel/wormhole">Womhole <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>

Allows exposing a kubernetes `kind: Service` between different clusters via L7 reverse TCP tunnels over websocket, just by using annotations. Similar to ngrok, teleport or skupper, but implemented specifically for Kubernetes. Mostly a learning project.

## <a href="https://github.com/glothriel/npviz">NpViz <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>

NpViz is a simple utility, that allows viewing all allowed connections between kubernetes pods using either active kubectl context or static directory with YAML resources as a source. It has a simple web-based UI, that can be interactively interpreted by the user.
