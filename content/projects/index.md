## <a href="https://github.com/glothriel/grf">GRF <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>

Gin REST Framework - DRF-style CRUD REST framework for go, using 1.18 generics instead of code generation. The most serious of my projects so far, this one I believe has a potential to be really useful tool.

## <a href="https://github.com/glothriel/wormhole">Wormhole <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>

Allows exposing a kubernetes `kind: Service` between different clusters via L7 reverse TCP tunnels over websocket, just by using annotations. Similar to ngrok, teleport or skupper, but implemented specifically for Kubernetes. Mostly a learning project.

## <a href="https://github.com/glothriel/npviz">NpViz <i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>

NpViz is a simple utility, that allows viewing all allowed connections between kubernetes pods using either active kubectl context or static directory with YAML resources as a source. It has a simple web-based UI, that can be interactively interpreted by the user.
